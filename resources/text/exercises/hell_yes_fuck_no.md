## Summary

Exercise: **"The Emotional Pendulum: Express, Observe, and Respond"**

**Objective:** 
To cultivate an understanding of how emotional responses can manifest physically and influence interpersonal communication, as well as fostering authentic expression.

**Materials Needed:** A list of open-ended questions for person A to ask.

**Instructions:**

1. **Pair Up**: Participants pair up (designated as person A and person B).

2. **Initial Question**: Person A asks person B a question from the list.

3. **Negative Response**: Person B responds very negatively to the question.

4. **Sacred Pause**: Each person takes a moment to observe how they physically feel from that interaction. This can include heart rate, muscle tension, body temperature, etc. They silently note these physical responses.

5. **Repeat Question**: Person A asks the same question again.

6. **Positive Response**: Person B responds very positively to the question.

7. **Sacred Pause**: Again, both participants take a moment to observe and silently note any changes in their physical state from this interaction.

8. **Third Questioning**: Person A asks the same question a third time.

9. **Authentic Response**: Person B responds authentically, expressing their true feelings and thoughts.

10. **Reflection and Sharing**: After the final 'sacred pause', both participants take turns sharing their physical observations and how they varied with each interaction. The aim here is to create awareness of the link between physical sensations and emotional reactions, and how these can influence communication. This sharing should be done with the principles of radical honesty, encouraging vulnerability and openness.

**Note:** The exercise is about observing, feeling, sharing, and accepting our body's reactions to emotional stimuli.

  
# Scanning

1. **Head and Face**: especially in the forehead and jaw.
2. **Neck, Shoulders and Upper Back**: 
3. **Stomach**: 
4. **Arms and Hands**: Starting from the shoulders, scanning can go down. 
5. **Lower Body**: Hips and below

Remember, the goal is to neutrally observe any sensations that might arise in these areas without judgment.
Sensations might include warmth, coolness, tension, relaxation, tingling, or even numbness.
