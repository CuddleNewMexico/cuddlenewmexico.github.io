# Cuddle Party Tomorrow (Sat, March 11th)

Hello,

We are excited to see everyone tomorrow for the Cuddle Party!

Here are a few quick notes to make sure everyone has a great time:

## 1. Hygiene

Please be squeaky clean tomorrow and avoid strong scents as some people have high sensitivity to different smells. Also remember to wear clean comfortable clothes (sweats, t-shirt, tank tops, pajamas. Modest coverage )

## 2. Timings

Come in on time (no later than 2pm). Doors will open 25 minutes before.
Door's will close at 2:10. No late access is allowed.

## 3. Food

We will provide some snacks, but please feel free to bring anything you wish to share. 
Remember it's a clean & sober event so no alcohol, etc... 

## 4. Address

>    Unitarian Universalist 
>    107 W Barcelona Rd,
>    Santa Fe, NM 87505
