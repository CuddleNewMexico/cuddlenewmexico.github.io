# concepts 

I believe there are 3 areas that make up a persons ability to consent
1. Express Consent - the 1st step is to say no
1. Recognize feelings - the 1st step is to check in with yourself
1. Explore Options - not sure of 1st step


## Ideas

### Exploring Circle

2 circles are made inner/outer. The inner circle are the askers and the outer circle are the answerers. Each member of the inner circle asks the outer circle their request. The Outer circle answers honestly yes/no. But regardless of the answer, no action is taken. The outer cirle rotates, and you ask again to the next person until you have asked everyone from the whole circle. Then the roles flip and you do it again.

The Exercise is meant to do 2 things. 
1. Practice asking for something you want
1. Get an idea of where these ideas might be fertile. 

### Exploring your reaction

pair up with someone.   
Person A asks a question.   
Person B Answers:  No, I would hate doing that
Person A asks Person B to check in with themselves and see how it felt.
Person A asks again.
Person B Answers:  Yes I would love to do that
Person B then checks internally to see how each answer feels. They do not share this feeling


### Exploring Self Options 
People work individually. Everyone closes their eyes. The instructor asks everyone to hold up a there closed hand. Then to think of 3 things they would like to happen today. After each idea, you raise a finger, until the entire group is showing 3 fingers

### Exploring Menu  
People pair up with a sheet. They ask each question 1 at a time: Would you like to ...
The other person answers No.
Then both people take a moment to reflect on how that felt. Did they like the option. This information is kept quiet.
