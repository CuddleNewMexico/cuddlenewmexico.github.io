## Emotions

Touch can release strong emotions. We want to listen to them. After all, emotions are our subconscious trying to alert us to something important that we should pay attention to. In and of themselves they are neither good nor bad but prompt to action based on an event happening. Here's a short primer for the basic 7 (Mad, Sad, Glad, Afraid, Nervous, Shame & Jealousy ). 

Always fill in the following sentence:

I felt __\<emotion>__ when __\<event>__ happened.

### Mad

Anger is telling you that something important is being threatened.

Questions to ask yourself:
1. What was important to me?
2. Was it really being threatened?
3. How could I reduce the threat?
4. How could I strengthen the thing I care about so this event wouldn't be a threat to it?

### Sad

Sorrow is telling you that something that used to be good for you, is no longer helping you and you need to let go.

Questions to ask yourself:
1. What use to be helping you?
1. What must you let go off?
1. What must you refill in yourself?

### Glad

Joy is telling you that something unexpectedly good happened.

Questions to ask yourself:

1. What happened that was good?
1. How can I make it happen again?

### Afraid 

Fear is telling you that you are in danger. It is trying to protect you. Be aware that fear manifests itself in two very different ways. During the actual danger and as a warning to avoid danger. We will be discussing the second stage as it is the most common.

Fear also helps you to slow down and focus. Gathering your internal resources for what is ahead.

Questions to ask yourself:
1. What action should be taken?
1. What previous event in my life does this remind me of?
1. How can I use this focus to achieve what I want?
And if this fear seems not to be helping you
1. How can I remove this trigger?


### Nervous

Anxiety is telling you that while you are not in danger at the moment, you need to do something or you will be. It is trying to motivate you to stop procrastinating and do something.

Questions to ask yourself:
1. What did I need to do?
1. What would have helped me to do it?

### Shame

Shame is alerting you that something you are doing is affecting your social connections.

Questions to ask yourself:
1. Who has been hurt?
1. What must be fixed?
1. How can I fix it?
1. How or what can I strengthen so this action doesn't weaken my connection?


### Jealousy

Jealousy is alerting you to a non-material need you have that is weak or missing. Often we respond to jealousy by trying to make the alert go away, but this misses the gift of jealousy. That it is telling us what we need to fill up to take care of ourselves.

Questions to ask yourself:
1. What am I missing in my life?
1. How can I have more of it?
1. How can I have enough of it that it doesn't bother me when someone else has it?
