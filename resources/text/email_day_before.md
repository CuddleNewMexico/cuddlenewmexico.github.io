# Cuddle Party Tomorrow (Sat, Sept 24th)

Hello,

We are excited to see everyone tomorrow for the Cuddle Party!

Here are a few quick notes to make sure everyone has a great time:

## 1. Hygiene

Please be squeaky clean tomorrow and avoid strong scents as some people have high sensitivity to different smells. Also remember to wear clean comfortable clothes (sweats, t-shirt, tank tops, pajamas. Modest coverage )

## 2. Timings

Come in time to have a covid test administered (no later than 3pm). They take 15 minutes to do. We will provide the test kits. Earlier is better. You must have your test started by 3pm to be admitted.

## 3. Food

We will provide some snacks, but feel free to bring anything you wish to share. 
Remember it's a clean & sober event so no alcohol, etc...
