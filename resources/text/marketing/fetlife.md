# Cuddles Party - Santa Fe

## A Plantic Consensual touch Event


Are you looking for a warm and welcoming space to relax, connect, and cuddle with others? If so, you're invited to our upcoming cuddle party in Santa Fe!

At our cuddle party, you'll have the chance to enjoy non-sexual touch and affection in a safe, consensual, and respectful environment. You can snuggle up with a cozy blanket, share a hug, or even participate in some light massage. We'll have experienced facilitators on hand to guide you through the process and ensure that everyone feels comfortable and respected.

Our cuddle party is open to people of all genders, ages, orientations, and backgrounds. Whether you're single or in a relationship, experienced or new to cuddling, you'll find a warm and accepting community at our event.
