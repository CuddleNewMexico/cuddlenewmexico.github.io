Hi,

We have a program called cuddle parties which are structured events for people to experience the benefits of physical touch and intimacy in a platonic and safe space. They are also a great place to learn about consent culture, to practice asking for what we need, setting boundaries, receiving as well as giving, and many other things. We beileve they might be of benefit to your patients and clients.

We would like to invite you to come and be our guest at a free cuddle party in Albuquerque on Sat Sept 24th.

Our facilitator (Pamela Bradford) has been facilitating cuddle parties since 2014 and is amazing. We even have a Certified Trauma Recovery Coach Supervisor on hand as sometimes touch can release intense feelings.

I hope you can make it. As I mentioned it is free, but a ticket is required. You can sign up here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/september-cuddles-albuquerque-tickets-409646592987

Thanks and hope to see you there,

Llewellyn Falco

ps. If you have any questions or concerns I would be happy to talk.
