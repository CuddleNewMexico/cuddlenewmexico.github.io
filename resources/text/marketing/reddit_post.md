Cuddle Party and Consent Workshop
Just wanted to put a note out about an upcoming Cuddle Party in Los Alamos on July 15th. If you're not familiar with these events, they're gatherings focused on non-sexual touch and connection. It's a unique and wholesome way to interact and meet new people, especially for those of us who might be touch-starved.



A key part of these events is the Consent Training. Before any cuddling starts, everyone goes through an interactive session about consent, communication, and boundaries. It's about creating an atmosphere where everyone feels safe and comfortable, where we can express our needs and limits freely.



All are welcome at this event, regardless of age, sex, gender identity, or orientation. It's a really good opportunity to learn more about the importance of consent, not just in a cuddle party context, but in day-to-day interactions as well. If you're interested or have questions, feel free to ask. Let's have a safe, respectful, and cozy time!
