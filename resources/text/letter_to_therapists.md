Hi,

Wanted to let you know that we are running a Free cuddle party in Albuquerque on Sat Sept 24th.

As you are probably aware, cuddle parties are both big on consent culture and platonic touch. Something many of your patients might benefit from.

But I wanted to take this opportunity to invite you so that you might check it out personally before suggesting it to others.

Our facilitator (Pamela Bradford) has been facilitating cuddle parties since 2014 and is amazing. We even have a Certified Trauma Recovery Coach Supervisor on hand as sometimes touch can release intense feelings.

I hope you can make it. As I mentioned it is free, but a ticket is required. You can sign up here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/september-cuddles-albuquerque-tickets-409646592987

Thanks and hope to see you there,

Llewellyn Falco

ps. If you have any questions or concerns I would be happy to talk.
