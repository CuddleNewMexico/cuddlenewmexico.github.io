**Note:** **No Late Entry Allowed**. Please arrive promptly at ____, doors will be closed at ____

Start your Southwest Lovefest off by connecting deeply and authentically with each other in a playful and platonic space. 

Snuggle Lab and Cuddle Party have collaborated to create a fun and safe space to explore empowered consent, meet new friends, and connect through non-sexual touch. 

This will start as a facilitated group workshop on consent, break into choose-your-own-adventure groups, and end with an open snuggle space.

All are welcome - newbies wanting to learn and watch (no touching required) to advanced snuggle pros excited to get the oxytocin flowing.

Start your conference off right with shared experiences that will last throughout the weekend and beyond.
