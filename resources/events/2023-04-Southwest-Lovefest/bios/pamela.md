 >"Cuddle parties are all about relaxing, laughing, having fun and getting to know new people. Often it's not even about the touch, it's about being in a safe place with other people and being acknowledged" 

Pamela has been facilitating cuddle parties since 2014. After a divorce Pamela found her life consumed by work and writing, leaving months passing without the opportunity for healthy touch.

She has lost count of the number of cuddle parties she has facilitated over the last decade.
