 # Llewellyn 
 
Llewellyn attended his first cuddle party in 2014. It was eye-opening to him; never before had he seen consent taught so clearly, with space to explore and experiment. An enthusiastic cuddler before, he started to apply his training in teaching and facilitation to his passion for authentic connection and community building. Years later he is still exploring new ways to teach, still loves to cuddle and even owns a full adult Winnie the Pooh costume.
