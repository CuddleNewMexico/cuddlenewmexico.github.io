# Los Alamos SnuggleLab!

Don't miss this opportunity to join us this Friday night for a special SnuggleLab.

Consent and boundaries educator Troi Deluz, founder of SnuggleLab is in town this week only and we didn't want to pass up a chance to have them share their expertise with us.

We know this is short notice, but hope you don't miss it.
