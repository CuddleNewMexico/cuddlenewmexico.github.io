Could you use more hugs in your life? How about a hand massage, a game of "thumb war", or just someone to sit next to while watching a movie? The word "snuggle" often leads people straight to the idea of "spooning", but touch comes in all sorts of forms. Maybe you want to more easily access your NO and practice requesting what you DO want - this class can help with that too! The wide world of touch becomes easy to explore once we learn the basics of consent, communication, and boundaries.

Intro to Positive Touch Culture is a presentation on how creating a culture of positive touch can benefit us all. We discuss ways to make exploring platonic touch safer and there are simple activities sprinkled throughout to help us practice ways to empower our voices in communicating both our desires and our boundaries.

If you feel unsure or shy about meeting new people or just curious about what all the "snuggle" terminology means - this is a great starting point. No touch is required -you are always at choice on your participation level and may leave after the Intro portion if you don't feel ready to join the snuggle party.
