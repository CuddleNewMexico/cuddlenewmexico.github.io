# Meet your Facilitator - Troi Deluz

> "I was pleasantly
surprised at what a comfortable environment the facilitators created,
especially when Troi presented the boundaries for snuggling and touch.
Troi&#39;s comfort with the subject matter really came through beautifully.
Their warmth, sensitivity, and sense of humor was a delightful
combination!" - Darcy Spencer, Ecstatic Dance

> "I felt safe, met, and loved not only as a team member, but also as a participant." - Oli O. Gung Fu Tea Master

> “I've attended several Intro workshops and other events. Troi is a wonderful facilitator who creates a very safe environment of trust... I've gone from Cynic to Fan of "snuggle parties," which (sadly) once upon a time I thought was code for "group foreplay" or "hookup party." Learning that people of both genders can honestly share platonic touch together was a revelation... do yourself a favor and check it out the Intro to Positive Touch Culture workshop. ” - Denise-Christine Collard

Troi has be pioneering Snuggle Parties in Eguene/Portland area since 2004. The creator of SnuggleLabs and a leader in the positive touch community, They currently work as a registered nurse, as well is a Reiki teacher.
